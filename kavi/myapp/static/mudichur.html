    <h1>Mudichur</h1>
    <h3><p>Mudichur is a rapidly growing, affordable residential locality in South Chennai (Tambaram Corporation) known for its proximity to the Outer Ring Road (ORR) and excellent connectivity to GST Road. It offers a mix of apartments and independent houses, with increasing popularity due to nearby IT hubs, schools, and the newly opened Kilambakkam bus terminus. However, the area is prone to significant waterlogging during monsoon seasons.
